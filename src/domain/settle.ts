 * Greedy largest-creditor-against-largest-debtor. It is not guaranteed to find
 * the theoretical minimum number of transfers — that problem is NP-hard — but
 * it never needs more than `n - 1`, and at a dinner table the difference
 * between optimal and near-optimal is one extra Venmo at most. Being able to
 * explain the result matters more than shaving a transfer off it.
 *
 * Two properties the tests pin down:
 *
 * 1. **No money is invented.** Every cent that leaves a debtor arrives at a
 *    creditor, so the transfers always net to zero.
 * 2. **Nobody is asked to overpay.** A person's outgoing transfers never
 *    exceed what they actually owe.
 *
 * When payments don't cover the bill the positions won't sum to zero. Rather
 * than fabricate a transfer to balance the books, the leftover is simply left
 * on the debtors' side and reported as unpaid — the restaurant is still owed
 * that money, and no amount of shuffling between friends changes it.
