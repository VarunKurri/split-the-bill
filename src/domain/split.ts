/**
 * The whole calculation, as one pure function of the bill.
 *
 * Three decisions are encoded here, and they are the ones that make or break
 * whether the answer feels fair at the table:
 *
 * 1. Items are split by weight, then by whole cents via largest-remainder
 *    allocation — so a $10 plate shared three ways is 3.34 / 3.33 / 3.33 and
 *    never 3.33 x 3 with a cent quietly vanishing.
 *
 * 2. Tax and tip are allocated in proportion to each person's item subtotal,
 *    not per head. The friend who only had a salad pays tip on a salad.
 *
 * 3. Unassigned items participate in that proportional allocation as a
 *    phantom claimant. Their tax and tip stay unclaimed rather than being
 *    silently redistributed onto the people who have already been assigned —
 *    so nobody is quietly overcharged for a plate nobody has owned up to.
 *
 * An item's split mode (equal, shares, percent) does not appear here on
 * purpose: all three are just ways of arriving at the weight vector, and the
 * arithmetic below is identical whichever was used.
